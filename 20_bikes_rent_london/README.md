This is the 20th dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   



Bikes rent in London -- loading dataset, plotting rides count data, resampling timestamps, describing the main trends, looking for anomaly values by smoothing the data with a simple moving average, calculating the difference between the real data and smoothed data, finding standard deviation and defining the 99% confidence interval. Then we compare values with the confidence interval to find data hikes and explain them.
 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
