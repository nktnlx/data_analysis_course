This is the 22nd dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   



App interface A/B -- Testing how images aspect ratio and a new order button design influence on the amount of orders placed by customers. Performed Levene's test to check group variance equality, Shapiro-Wilk test to check groups for normality, one-way ANOVA to check statistically significant difference between tested groups, Tukey's test to find statistically significant difference between groups, linear model multivariate analysis of variance, visualized and interpreted results, gave recommendations to put (or not to put) changes into production.
 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
