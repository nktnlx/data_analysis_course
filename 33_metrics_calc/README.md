This is the 33rd dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   



Metrics calculations -- Google analytics data cleaning and calculation of following metrics: number of unique users, conversion, average check, average purchases per user, ARPPU, ARPU.

 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
