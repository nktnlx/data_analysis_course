This is the fifth dataset analysed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


Raw Data Handling -- creating dataframe from a set of csv-files stored in various folders. Practicing Python skills to automate data handling.  

Folders tree is shown below:

Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
