This is the tenth dataset analysed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


Visits by Browser -- analising web-site visits. Defining proportion of real users and visits by bots. Findig the most popular browser for users and for bots. Barplotting results, downloading data using **Google Docs API** and merging it to our dataframe. Read_csv, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, pivot, fillna, assign and merge methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis. 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
