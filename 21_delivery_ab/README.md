This is the 21st dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   



Delivery A/B** -- Finding how a new navigational algorithm has changed the delivery time of the service. Formulating null and alternative hypothesis and performing A/B test with help of t-test.
 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
