This is the tenth dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


Telegram Bot Airflow Reporting  -- reading an advertising campaign data from Google Docs spreadsheet, creating pandas dataframe to calculate clicks, views, **CTR** and money spent on the campaign. Calculating day by day change of the metrics, writing report with results to a txt file and sending this file via telegram bot to your mobile phone. The script is executed by Airflow every Monday at 12:00 p.m. 

Do not forget to create your own json file with Telegram token and chat_id to run the script properly.  

Files description:  
mini_project.py -- is for running the script in terminal  
mini_project_dag.py -- DAG with the script to be executed with Airflow by a preset schedule  
report_2019-04-01.txt -- the result of running the script  



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
