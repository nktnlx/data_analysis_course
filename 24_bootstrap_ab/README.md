This is the 24th dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   



Bootstrap A/B -- comparing results of Mann-Whitney test and Bootstrap mean/median running on data with and without outliers.   
 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
