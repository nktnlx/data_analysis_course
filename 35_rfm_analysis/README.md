This is the 35th dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   



RFM analysis -- performed RFM analysis, built LTV heatmap and found insights about users segmentation.

 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
