This is the 23rd dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   



Cars sales -- predicting cars sales price using linear regerssion models (statsmodels.api & statsmodels.formula.api). Finding statistically significant predictors.  
 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
