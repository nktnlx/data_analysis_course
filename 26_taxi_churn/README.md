This is the 26th dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   



Taxi Churn -- performing Exploratory Data Analysis, defining churn, checking distributions for normality with Shapiro-Wilk test, plotting data using plotly and A/B testing four different hypothesis with Chi-squared test, Dunn's test, Mann-Whitney U non-pararmetric test.

 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
