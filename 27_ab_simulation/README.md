This is the 27th dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   



A/B simulation -- performed a range of A/B tests to simulate how sample size and the magnitude of difference between samples influence A/B tests performance. Investigated situations when we could have a false positive error. Gained valuable lessons on A/B tests performance.

 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
