This is the eighth dataset analysed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


Avocado Price -- Comparing avocado average, simple moving average and exponential weighted average price values. Categorizing delay data and labelling it. Plotting results with help of subplots and interactive Plotly plots.  



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
