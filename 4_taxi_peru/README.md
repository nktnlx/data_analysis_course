This is the fourth dataset analysed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


Taxi in Peru -- analising  taxi orders in Peru with Pandas. An Exploratory Data Analysis was performed. Drivers' score, passengers' score, **DAU** and **MAU** metrics were calculated and plotted with Seaborn.   

 


Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
