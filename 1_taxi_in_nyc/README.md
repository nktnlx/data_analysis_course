This is the first dataset analysed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


Analising NYC taxi orders with Pandas. Read_csv, rename, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, idxmax, idxmin, value_counts, pivot methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis.  
 


Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
