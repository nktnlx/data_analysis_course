This is the tenth dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


Bookings in London -- used Pandahouse and SQL queries to import data from Clickhouse into pandas dataframe. Processed imported data and performed Exploratory Data Analysis. Built scatterplot, distplot, lineplot and heatmap using Seaborn and Matplotlib.  





Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
