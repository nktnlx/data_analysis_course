The breakdown of revenue by country is shown in the bottom left corner. The first place by revenue is occupied by Great Britain. Moreover, the revenue indicators in Great Britain for the reporting period exceeded the revenue in the Netherlands (the second place) by 23.78 times.  \n",

    "Since the major part of the store's revenue is generated in the UK, an analysis of sales in this country was carried out on the right side of the dashboard. The top right corner shows the breakdown of revenue by month. It can be seen that the peak of sales is in November. This is most likely due to the eve of the Christmas holidays. After analyzing the products sold in November, we can see that the top 10 items sold in terms of revenue include Christmas decorations, garlands and New Year's gifts (frames, thermo mugs, red Christmas bags). Details on cost, quantity, as well as total revenue from the top 10 products in November are shown on the dashboard.  \n",

    "- avoiding a shortage in warehouses of Christmas goods in the month of November,\n",
    "- to diversify the assortment of the store, to conduct campaigns to attract customers in order to avoid a significant seasonal decline in revenue in the the UK (the main market) in the period from January to September.  "
