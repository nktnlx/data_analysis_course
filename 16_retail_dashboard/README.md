This is the tenth dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


Retail dashboard -- built a series of visualizations and a dashboard using SQL queries and Redash. Calculated and checked the dynamics of **MAU** and **AOV**. Found an anomaly in data, defined the market generating the majority of revenue, analyzed the most popular goods sold in the store. Wrote a dashboard summary with recommendation to push up sales.  




Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
