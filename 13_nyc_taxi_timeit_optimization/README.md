This is the thirteenth dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


NYC taxi & timeit optimization -- calculating distance of a ride using pick-up and drop-off coordinates. Compared a couple of ways to apply distance calculation to the dataframe. The optimization helped to decrease calculation run-time about 3276 times! Checked calculation results, found outliers using boxplot graphs and descriptive statistics. Fixed dataframe by removing outliers and found the cost of the longest ride.  




Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
