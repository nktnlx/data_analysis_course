This dataset is from [Yandex Praktikum data-analyst course](https://praktikum.yandex.ru/data-analyst/) I was taking in Feb-March 2021.   



Yandex Music -- analyzing music streaming platform songs popularity, comparing music preferences and listening templates in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg. Reading and cleaning data, renaming columns, removing duplicates, dealing with missing data, slicing dataframe to query required portion of data.    
 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
