This is the fourteenth dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


Bikes rent in Chicago -- dates to dateformat conversion, resampling data to aggregate by days, automatically merging data from distinct files into one dataframe using os.walk(), differentiating bikes rents by user type, finding the most popular destination points overall and based on the week of the day.  





Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
