This is the second dataset analysed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


Hotel Bookings -- analising hotel bookings with Pandas. Read_csv, info, rename, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, idxmax, idxmin, value_counts, pivot methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis. Customers **Churn rate** was calculated.  
 


Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
