This is the final project done by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   



Final project -- you're employed in a mobile games development company. A Product Manager gives you following tasks:
* Find and visualize retention,
* Make a decision based on the A/B test data,
* Suggest a number of metrics to evaluate the results of the last monthly campaign.  

 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
