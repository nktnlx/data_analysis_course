This is the nineth dataset analysed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


Ads Campaign -- Plotting data in logarithmic scale to find the type of data distribution, finding ad_id with an anomalistict number of views. Comparing average and simple moving average views data. Categorizing clients' registration data and labelling it. Plotting results with help of interactive Plotly plot.    



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
