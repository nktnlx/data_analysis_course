Hi there!


I'm learning to code, interested in data analytics and data science, aiming to be hired by the mid of 2021.  
This repository is for [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.    

The course curriculum includes the following technologies and topics mastered by me:  
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Seaborn
5. Google APIs
6. Git
7. Airflow
8. SQL
9. ClickHouse
10. PostgreSQL
11. Redash
12. Superset
13. Statistics
14. A/B-tests
15. Bootstrapping
16. Power Analysis
17. Tableau
18. DAU, MAU, ARPU, LTV, Retention, CR and other metrics
19. Product Development basics
20. Product Management basics
21. Soft-skills  
   
   
   
   
   
**List of projects:**
1. **Taxi in NYC** -- analising NYC taxi orders with Pandas. Read_csv, rename, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, idxmax, idxmin, value_counts, pivot methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis.
2. **Hotel Bookings** -- analising hotel bookings with Pandas. Read_csv, info, rename, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, idxmax, idxmin, value_counts, pivot methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis. Customers **Churn rate** was calculated.  
3. **User Logs** -- analising customers data. Finding the most popular platform and the most active users. Visualizing data with Seaborn distplot, barplot and countplot methods.       
4. **Taxi in Peru** -- analising  taxi orders in Peru with Pandas. An Exploratory Data Analysis was performed. Drivers' score, passengers' score, **DAU** and **MAU** metrics were calculated and plotted with Seaborn.   
5. **Raw Data Handling** -- creating dataframe from a set of csv-files stored in various folders. Practicing Python skills to automate data handling.  
6. **Retail in Germany** -- having a dataset with purchases of clients from Europe. Count basic sales statistics for clients from Germany. Duplicated, drop_duplicates, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, assign, quantile and str methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis. 
7. **Error in Transactions Data** -- we've found and corrected an error while analising a dataset with transactions. Plotting data in logarithmic scale, converting data to datetime format as well as implementing describe, isna, sum, value_counts, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, rename, min, max and pivot methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis.   
8. **Avocado Price** -- comparing avocado average, simple moving average and exponential weighted average price values. Categorizing delay data and labeling it. Plotting results with help of subplots and interactive Plotly plots.  
9. **Ads Campaign** -- plotting data in logarithmic scale to find the type of data distribution, finding ad_id with an anomalistic number of views. Comparing average and simple moving average views data. Calculating clients' registration to publishing ad conversion rate (**CR**). Categorizing clients' registration data and labeling it. Plotting results with help of interactive Plotly plot.  
10. **Visits by Browser** -- analising web-site visits. Defining proportion of real users and visits by bots. Finding the most popular browser for users and for bots. Bar-plotting results, downloading data using **Google Docs API** and merging it to our dataframe. Read_csv, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, pivot, fillna, assign and merge methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis.
11. **Telegram Bot Airflow Reporting**  -- reading an advertising campaign data from Google Docs spreadsheet, creating pandas dataframe to calculate clicks, views, **CTR** and money spent on the campaign. Calculating day by day change of the metrics, writing report with results to a txt file and sending this file via telegram bot to your mobile phone. The script is executed by Airflow every Monday at 12:00 p.m.   
12. **SQL Tasks** -- SQL excercises done by me while passing this data analysis course. Clickhouse (via Tabix) was used to solve the tasks.  






Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
