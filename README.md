Unfortunately, we were not able to pass the test (FPR was greater than significance value). Thus, we have to dig into data and find the reason of malfunction. After removing the corrupted data we were able to pass the A/A-test.
26. [Taxi Churn](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_course/tree/main/26_taxi_churn) -- performing Exploratory Data Analysis, defining churn, checking distributions for normality with **Shapiro-Wilk test**, plotting data using plotly and A/B testing four different hypothesis with **Chi-squared test, Dunn's test, Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test**.

Investigated situations when we could have a false positive error. Gained valuable **lessons on A/B tests performance**.
