Hi there!


I'm learning to code, interested in data analytics and data science, aiming to be hired by the mid of 2021.  
This repository is for [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.    

The course curriculum includes the following technologies and topics mastered by me:  
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Seaborn
5. Google APIs
6. Git
7. Airflow
8. SQL
9. ClickHouse
10. PostgreSQL
11. Redash
12. Supers–µt
13. Statistics
14. A/B-tests
15. Bootstrapping
16. Power Analysis
17. Tableau
18. DAU, MAU, ARPU, LTV, Retention and other metrics
19. Product Development basics
20. Product Management basics
21. Softskills  
   
   
   
   
   
**List of projects:**
1. Taxi in NYC -- analising NYC taxi orders with Pandas. Read_csv, rename, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, idxmax, idxmin, value_counts, pivot methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis.
2. Hotel Bookings -- analising hotel bookings with Pandas. Read_csv, info, rename, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, idxmax, idxmin, value_counts, pivot methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis. Customers **Churn rate** was calculated.  
3. User Logs -- analising customers data. Finding the most popular platform and the most active users. Visualizing data with Seaborn distplot, barplot and countplot methods.       


Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
