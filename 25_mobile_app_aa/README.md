This is the 25th dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   



Mobile App A/A -- running A/A test to check data splitting system works well. Unfortunately, we were not able to pass the test (FPR was greater than significance value). Thus, we have to dig into data and find the reason of malfunction. After removing the corrupted data we were able to pass the A/A-test.  

 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
