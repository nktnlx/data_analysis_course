This is the 36th set of tasks done by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   



Probabilities -- solving probability theory problems including AND/OR probabilities, Bernoulli trial and conditional probability (the Bayes theorem).

 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
