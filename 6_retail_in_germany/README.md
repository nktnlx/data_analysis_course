This is the sixth dataset analysed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


Retail in Germany -- having a dataset with purchases of clients from Europe. Count basic sales statistics for clients from Germany. Duplicated, drop_duplicates, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, assign, quantile and str methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis.  



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
