This is the tenth dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


Video games --  analising video games sales dynamics with Pandas. Read_csv, head, columns, dtypes, info, isna, dropna, describe, mode, shape, groupby, agg, sort_values, rename, index, to_list, value_count methods were user for Exploratory Data Analysis. Barplot, boxplot and lineplot were used for graphing results.    




Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
