This is the seventh dataset analysed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   


Error in Transactions Data -- we've found and corrected an error while analysing a dataset with transactions. Plotting data in logarithmic scale, converting data to datetime format as well as implementing describe, isna, sum, value_counts, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, rename, min, max and pivot methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis.   



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
