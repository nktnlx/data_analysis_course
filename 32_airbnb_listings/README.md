This is the 32nd dataset analyzed by me while passing [data analysis course](https://karpov.courses/) I've enrolled in January 2021.   




[Airbnb Listings Analytics](https://public.tableau.com/profile/nktn.lx#!/vizhome/LondonAirbnbListingsAnalyticalDashboardpractice5/Dashboard1) -- **Tableau Public dashboard** consisted of: calculated renting property occupation rate; analytical chart to choose the best property by occupation rate, review score and price per night; a ranked table of top 10 listings by calculated potential annual revenue; average price, average occupation rate and a number of unique listings KPIs; filters by neighbourhood, occupation rate and a number of reviews per the last twelve month.
 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
